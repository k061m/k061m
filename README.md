 Hi, I'm @k061m
👀 I'm interested in optical sensor development and biomedical technology. My recent research involves designing an in-vitro optical sensor for estimating glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) percentages1.
🌱 I'm currently learning microcontroller programming and sensor design techniques. Specifically, I've been working with Arduino microcontrollers like the ATmega328P and exploring optical sensing methodologies1.
💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on medical device projects, sensor development, and Arduino-based research initiatives. I'm particularly passionate about creating innovative solutions in biomedical technology.
📫 How to reach me: Best contacted through GitHub or professional research networks focused on medical technology and sensor design.
😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: I've developed a portable optical sensor using green and yellow LEDs with precise spectral emission characteristics, capable of measuring HbA1c levels with high accuracy1. My work involves complex mathematical modeling and regression analysis to interpret sensor data.
